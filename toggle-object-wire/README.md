# Toggle Object Wire and Subsurf Modifier - Blender Addon

This addon makes toggling object wire and subsurf modifiers really quick. You can select to toggle all objects in the scene or selected objects only.

It assigns two new shortcuts:
- Toggle object wire `\`
- Toggle object subsurf modifiers `shift + \`

Note: The used key `\` (located between Shift and Z key on English keyboard) is named GRLESS in Blender's keymap.
